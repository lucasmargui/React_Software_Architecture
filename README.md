## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Code Splitting

Break code into smaller chunks and load them on demand as needed.

## Atomic Design 

Atomic design is a methodology for creating design systems that emphasizes building user interfaces in a hierarchical and modular manner. It was developed by Brad Frost as a way to address the challenges of designing and maintaining large-scale digital products. The term "atomic" refers to the idea of breaking down interface components into their smallest, most basic elements, much like the building blocks of matter in chemistry.

## MVC 

MVC, which stands for Model-View-Controller, is a software architectural pattern commonly used in the development of user interfaces, particularly for web applications. It divides an application into three interconnected components:

Model: This component represents the data and the business logic of the application. It encapsulates the data and provides methods to access and manipulate that data. The model notifies the view of any changes in the data so that the view can update accordingly. In essence, the model is the backbone of the application, managing the data and its behavior.

View: The view is responsible for presenting the data to the user in a particular format, often as a graphical user interface (GUI). It displays information from the model to the user and forwards user input to the controller. Views are usually passive components, meaning they don't directly interact with the data or perform any business logic; instead, they rely on the controller to handle user actions and update the model as necessary.

Controller: The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It receives user input from the view, processes it (e.g., performs validation or initiates actions), and updates the model accordingly. It also listens for changes in the model and updates the view to reflect those changes. Essentially, the controller controls the flow of the application, orchestrating interactions between the user, the model, and the view.

## Redux

Redux is a JS library for predictable and maintainable global state management.

### Redux + Next.js: Example.

- Importing Necessary Functions: The code imports createSlice and configureStore from the @reduxjs/toolkit package. These are used to create Redux slices and configure the Redux store, respectively.

- Creating a Slice: The createSlice function is used to define a Redux slice. A slice in Redux is a portion of the state and the corresponding logic for updating that state. In this case, a slice named 'counter' is created with an initial state object { value: 0 } and two reducers: incremented and decremented.

- Exporting Actions: The actions created by createSlice are exported. These actions are incremented and decremented, which correspond to the reducers defined in the slice.

- Configuring the Store: The configureStore function is used to create a Redux store. It takes an object with a reducer property, which is set to counterSlice.reducer. This means that the reducer function generated by createSlice is used to update the store's state.

- Subscribing to Store Changes: A subscription function is added to the store using store.subscribe(). This function logs the current state of the store every time it changes.

- Dispatching Actions: Actions are dispatched to the store using store.dispatch(). Since the actions were exported from the slice, they are directly accessible. First, incremented() is dispatched twice, which increments the value in the state by 1 each time. Then, decremented() is dispatched once, which decrements the value by 1.

- Console Output: As actions are dispatched, the console outputs the current state of the store after each action is processed.

```
CreateNoopStorage function:
```

This function creates a storage object that mimics the behavior of a storage mechanism like localStorage but doesn't actually store any data.
  
It has methods like getItem, setItem, and removeItem, all of which return promises resolving to null, the value passed to setItem, and undefined, respectively.

```
Conditional Assignment of storage:
```

It checks if the window object is defined. If it is, it calls createWebStorage("local"), presumably to create a local storage mechanism. Otherwise, it falls back to the createNoopStorage function.

```
authPersistConfig:
```

This object defines configuration options for persisting Redux state. It specifies a key for the state in the storage, the storage mechanism to use (either localStorage or the noop storage), and an array of items to whitelist for persistence (in this case, just "authState").

```
persistedReducer:
```

This is a Redux reducer enhanced by the redux-persist library. It takes authPersistConfig as a parameter and wraps around the authReducer, ensuring that the state managed by authReducer is persisted according to the configuration provided.

```
rootReducer:
```

This is the combined reducer for the Redux store. It combines the auth reducer with any other reducers that might be added in the future.

```
Redux Store Configuration:
```

The Redux store is configured using configureStore, where the rootReducer is provided as the reducer. Additionally, custom middleware is applied to handle serialization checks, with serializableCheck set to false to disable serializability checks.

```
Exporting Types and Hooks:
```

- It exports RootState and AppDispatch types, which are derived from the store's state and dispatch types, respectively.
- It exports two custom hooks useAppDispatch and useAppSelector using React-Redux's useDispatch and useSelector hooks but with types specifically tailored to the store's dispatch and state.
