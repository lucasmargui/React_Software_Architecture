- Importing Necessary Functions: The code imports createSlice and configureStore from the @reduxjs/toolkit package. These are used to create Redux slices and configure the Redux store, respectively.

- Creating a Slice: The createSlice function is used to define a Redux slice. A slice in Redux is a portion of the state and the corresponding logic for updating that state. In this case, a slice named 'counter' is created with an initial state object { value: 0 } and two reducers: incremented and decremented.

- Exporting Actions: The actions created by createSlice are exported. These actions are incremented and decremented, which correspond to the reducers defined in the slice.

- Configuring the Store: The configureStore function is used to create a Redux store. It takes an object with a reducer property, which is set to counterSlice.reducer. This means that the reducer function generated by createSlice is used to update the store's state.

- Subscribing to Store Changes: A subscription function is added to the store using store.subscribe(). This function logs the current state of the store every time it changes.

- Dispatching Actions: Actions are dispatched to the store using store.dispatch(). Since the actions were exported from the slice, they are directly accessible. First, incremented() is dispatched twice, which increments the value in the state by 1 each time. Then, decremented() is dispatched once, which decrements the value by 1.

- Console Output: As actions are dispatched, the console outputs the current state of the store after each action is processed.
